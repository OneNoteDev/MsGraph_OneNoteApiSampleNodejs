### Prerequisites

**Tools and Libraries** you will need to download, install, and configure for your development environment.

-	[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download)
-	[Express framework for Node.js](http://expressjs.com)
-	You have a normal URL with hostname (not just an IP address) to use for the Redirect URL. If you run this from your own desktop, you'll need to modify your Hosts file (in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc for Windows machines and /private/etc for Macs) and map your local server IP address to a new domain name, as in the following example. ![Modify your HOSTS file to map your local server IP address.](images/HostsFile.png)

**Accounts**

-	As the developer, you'll need to [have a Microsoft account and get a client ID string](http://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/dn575426.aspx) so your app can authenticate with the Microsoft Azure AD v2.0 endpoint.
-	As the user of the sample, you'll need a Microsoft account so the OneNote API can send the pages to your OneDrive.

### Using the sample

After you've setup your web server described above,....

1.	Download the repo as a ZIP file to your local computer, and extract the files. Or, clone the repository into a local copy of Git.
2.	Go to the [Microsoft app registration page](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index).
3.	On the API Settings page, set Mobile or desktop setting to No.
4.	Set the Redirect URI to the domain name of your web site, as in the following example. The root domain name must be unique, so if you use one domain for testing and another for production, you'll need to register separate client ids and secrets for each domain. ![Setting API properties in the Microsoft application portal.](images/OneNoteMSAScreen.png)
5.	On the App Setting page, copy the client ID and secret into the config.js file.
6.	Open a command prompt and go to the root directory of the project.
7.	Setup project dependencies with the `npm install` command.
8.	Run the app with the `npm start` command.
9.	Open a browser and navigate to the app running by default on port 3000.
10.	Login using your Microsoft account, and allow the app to create pages in your OneNote notebooks.
